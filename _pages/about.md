News!
======
* **One Paper Accepted by Optics Express**
* I am actively looking forward to Research Assitant/ Research Intern Positions in HK/China Mainland.

Biography
======
I am currently a senior undergraduate student at the School of Mathematics and Computer Science, Nanchang University, pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, and in the future, I will pursue an MPhil degree at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou).  **(Wechat: x_time_lifer )**

My research interests focus on robotics/autonomous driving perception, robot algorithm research, such as robot motion generation and reinforcement learning, LLMs, etc. I am committed to learning and advancing research in the field of Embodied AI, and I also have an ideal of AGI.

I was honored to be advised by Professor [Qiegen Liu](https://github.com/yqx7150/yqx7150.github.com) and [Wenbo Wan](https://teacher.ncu.edu.cn/publish/wanwenbo/) at [LIVE - Laboratory of Imaging and Vision Expression](https://www.labxing.com/lab/1018/home) starting from October 2022, where my focus on solving the problem of reconstruction quality being limited by the field of hologram in digital holography.
